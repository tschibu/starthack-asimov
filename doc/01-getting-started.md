# Getting Started

## Challenges

There were 8 different challenges which you could apply.
We were mainly interested in the Challenges from the following partners:

- Autosense (Crash Visualization)
- SBB (Recylce)
- Laica (AR)
- BOSCH IOT-Lab (Sensor Car)


Alls case descriptions can be viewed here:

We applied for the Autosense challenge and got it (limit of 15 Teams per challange).
The challenge is as follow:


## AUTOSENSE / VOLVO Challenge

*Generate Car Crash Image, visualize impact and direction using sensor data*

**Your challenge if you choose to accept:**

Build Microservice(s) to generate Image with 3D object simulating impact forces for given time offset (from crash). Deploy Microservice(s) on Swisscom Application Cloud (cloud foundry). Provide API(s) for submitting Input data (stream) and getting the Result. Generate output for each submitted Crash Record : Direction of the impact (Impact angle and energy), visualize the damage show expected place of impact on car


**Winner is the Team who:**

Has identified the maximum number of crashes correctly providing - Correct impact direction & Most accurate 3D simulation (compared to real crash picture)


**How it will be measured:**

For each submitted Crash Record AND time offset, generate Image with Direction of the impact (Impact angle and energy), Visualized damage and Time offset with the maximum force/damage on the object. Crash Record is submitted to the service. The calculated impact direction will be compared with pictures from real crash.


**Restrictions:**

Service must be deployable on cloud infrastructure (AWS/Cloud Foundry/Kubernetes/Docker). Service should use as few as possible external APIs. Given Data Models and API POST Requests structure must be used.
